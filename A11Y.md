# Accessibility
## The way we improve
### Image
We've tried to setup an `alt` attribute for any image element displayed on our application, and make these descriptions meaningful and human-understandable. Each `alt` contains the listing title so that users with visual disability could use a tool like screen reader to find out which listing they are "looking" at.
### Form
We've tried to include a label with any input areas so that screen-reader nowadays could identify what the input is for.
### Colour Usage
The whole application is designed with simple and high-contrast colours to improve readability.
### Font
We tried to use different font weights for some elements that should be emphasized.  
We don't use extra small text.  
We use proper headings and spacing to split out sections.
### Animation
The application does not contain any animated elements except **Bootstrap**'s native `Carousels` component, an element to display images as rolling gallery. But auto-slide can be disabled by putting the pointer on it.
### Blink/Flash
The application does not contain any blinking or flashing elements.
## The way we test
### LightHouse
We mainly use the Chrome built-in **LightHouse**** tool to analyze our pages. Every page has achieved high scores (> 95), mainly 100.
### Windows Narrator
Narrator is a screen-reading application that's built into Windows 11. We make sure every element on our pages can be detected by Narrator and is human-understandable.
