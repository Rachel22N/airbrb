# User Interface & User Experience
## Structure & Layout
We keep our page as simple as possible so as not to make users overload.
## Affordance
**Bootstrap**'s native component design is accepted by many users. We follow the usage guide to create a clear interface and make every interactive element (e.g. `button`, `link`) look interactive.
## Visibility
None of our elements is hidden except for mobile-responsive header links. The links can be viewed by pressing the hamburger-style menu button.
## Feedback
Each of users' successful/failed attempts of an action results in a page change/re-render.
## Constraints
A good example is on the listing detail page. If the user is not logged in, the section of booking and reviewing is hidden. If the user does not yet have a successful booking of the property, the review section is disabled.
## Consistency
We remain using the same header across the whole application.  
We design the listing item in the same way.
## Mapping
For designing the form, we follow general knowledge of how they look like on other platforms. We group the form (e.g. listing creation form) into categories, using an order that people would expect.
